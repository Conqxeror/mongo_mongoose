# Installation Guide for MongoDB and Mongoose

This guide will walk you through the steps to install MongoDB and Mongoose on your system. Follow these instructions to set up a local development environment.

## Installing MongoDB

### Windows

1. Download the MongoDB Community Edition installer for Windows from the official website: [MongoDB Download Center](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).

2. Run the installer and follow the installation wizard.

3. During the installation, you can choose the "Complete" setup type to install MongoDB Server as a Windows service and MongoDB Compass, a graphical user interface.

4. Complete the installation process and make sure to select the option to run the MongoDB Compass after installation.

### macOS

1. Install MongoDB using Homebrew by running the following commands in your terminal:

    ```bash
    brew tap mongodb/brew
    brew install mongodb-community
    ```

2. Start MongoDB as a background service:

    ```bash
    brew services start mongodb-community
    ```

### Linux (Ubuntu)

1. Follow the official MongoDB installation guide for Ubuntu: [Install MongoDB Community Edition on Ubuntu](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/).

2. After adding the MongoDB repository, install the package:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org
    ```

3. Start the MongoDB service:

    ```bash
    sudo service mongod start
    ```

## Installing Mongoose

Mongoose is an ODM (Object-Document Mapper) that provides a higher-level abstraction for MongoDB. It simplifies interactions with MongoDB in Node.js applications.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. If not, you can download and install them from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installing Mongoose

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install Mongoose globally:

```bash
npm install -g mongoose
```

This installs Mongoose globally on your system, making it accessible from any Node.js project.

## Verify Installations

After installing MongoDB and Mongoose, you can verify the installations by checking the versions:

### MongoDB

Open a terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
mongod --version
```

### Mongoose

Run the following command:

```bash
mongoose --version
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see the version numbers for MongoDB and Mongoose.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed MongoDB and Mongoose on your system. You are now ready to explore the world of MongoDB and Mongoose for your Node.js applications.
